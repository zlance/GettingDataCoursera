# Getting Data Coursera Project

The run_analysis.R

1. Takes the raw files from the study 
2. Loads them into the memory with feature file as a header and merges the test and training sets 
3. Loads the activity and subject files and adds them to the merged set in step 2
4. Saves the merged set as tidy1.txt
5. Creates a separate set with averages based on subject/activity descriptor and saves the new set as tidy2.txt
 
The assumption is that the file is downloaded and the working directory is set to the root of the download.
